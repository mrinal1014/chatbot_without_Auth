# 🤖 AI Chatbot with Gesture Control – Team Us 💞

This is a dynamic, voice-powered AI chatbot designed with hand gesture control and an animated avatar interface. Originally planned as a Django project, we transitioned to a static frontend implementation using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** due to limitations in backend deployment knowledge during the hackathon timeline.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project was built as a **Mini Project (4th Semester)** for Adamas University. The aim was to demonstrate a creative AI chatbot with:

- Natural human-computer interaction  
- Hand gesture commands  
- Custom styling, animation, and speech integration

## ⚠️ Note on Backend

Initially, this project was intended to be developed using Django with a REST API backend.  
However, due to limited deployment experience and time constraints, the backend was replaced with a **fully functional static frontend version** using vanilla JavaScript and hosted client-side.
